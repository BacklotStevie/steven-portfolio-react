            <h1 class='m-10  text-lg text-indigo-900'>From writing comic books in elementary school to film reviews in college, I have always had a passion for storytelling through various mediums. Creative through words and expression, I always tried to find different ways to tell tales, to solve problems and create ideas. Once I started designing, I realized that a whole new opportunity had presented itself to me. The opportunity to not only create my own vision of designs, websites or articles - but to help bring those to life for others.</h1>
            <h1 class='m-10  text-lg text-indigo-900'>With a Bachelor's degree in Public Relations from Florida International University, and a coding background from Ironhack Miami, I look to merge my design skills with my expertise in writing, in an attempt to create the best product possible for myself, and for clients. A driven, passionate individual, I live to help bring other's dreams and ideas to life.</h1>
            <h1 class='pb-15  text-lg text-indigo-900'>Everyone has an idea, and with that idea, a story. Let's get yours out there, together.</h1>
